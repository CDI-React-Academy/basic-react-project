Create React App

In order to learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer.

  * The create-react-app is an officially supported way to create React applications.
  * If you have NPM and Node.js installed, you can create a React application by first installing the create-react-app.
  * Install create-react-app by running this command in your terminal:
  * Create a new USER_NAME folder inside the repo
      REPO>USER_NAME_FOLDER>npm install -g create-react-app
  
  You are now ready to create your first React application!
  * Run this command to create a React application named myfirstreact:
      REPO>USER_NAME_FOLDER >npx create-react-app myfirstreact
